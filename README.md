# THIS OR THAT

This or That is a creative approach to a social media website. It utilizes points and simple questions to provide a more interactive experience for users and media content. The app itself allows users to create and customize an account, wager points on posts by selecting one of the answers of a simple question provided by each post, create post of their own, and view two different leaderboards to see who is gaining the most points on the site.

## My app utilizes:

AmazonS3 Buckets
Font Awesome
js-cookie
React Router Dom
gunicorn
whitenoise
Django
React
djangorestframework
django-rest-auth
django-allauth

My app is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://final-project-c2tm.herokuapp.com/).
